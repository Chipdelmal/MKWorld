# Mario Kart World: Build Analyzer

Just some tools I've been building to compare Mario Kart world character-kart combinations. Please have a look at my blogpost for more information on how it all connects.

## Dash build comparison

The UI is coded in [radar.py](./radar.py) and a live version can be found [here](https://mkworld-buildcompare.onrender.com/) (just be patient with the loading as I'm using the free tier).

## HiPlot

The code to generate this HTML file is in [hiplot](./hiplot.py) and the live counterpart can be found [here](https://chipdelmal.github.io/media/mkw/parallel.html).
